  - ✅ Dependency management (leader-follower, database clusters)
  - ✅ Post-upgrade validation (automated testing)
  - ✅ Staged rollout with pause/resume capability

### 1.2 Server Organization
- **Total Servers**: 10,000 servers

  - **Tier 2 (Operations - 2500 servers)**: Base operations, navigation, power management
  - **Tier 3 (Research - 2500 servers)**: Scientific research, data processing, non-critical workloads

- **Geographic Distribution**:
  - Multiple lunar base locations (3-5 sites)
  - Servers grouped by location, cluster, and service type
  - Some air-gapped clusters for critical systems

- **Server Characteristics**:
  - Heterogeneous (different roles and configurations)
  - Kubernetes clusters with some traditional VM-based workloads
  - Mix of stateful and stateless services

### 1.3 Approval & Control Requirements

  - Live progress dashboard (on Moon - 0 latency)
  - Earth dashboard (2.5s latency acceptable)
  - Per-server status tracking
  - Overall campaign health metrics

- **Alerting**:
  - Critical: Tier 1 failures, rollback storms, bandwidth exhaustion
  - Warning: Individual failures, slower-than-expected progress
  - Info: Milestone completions, phase transitions

- **Audit Trail**:
  - Complete history of all upgrades (success/failure)
  - Approval records for Tier 1 systems
  - Rollback events with root cause
  - Compliance reporting for safety-critical systems

  - One-way: ~1.25 seconds
  - Variability: ±0.1s due to orbital mechanics

- **Bandwidth Limitations**:
  - **Total Available**: 50 Mbps shared bandwidth
  - **Reserved for Operations**: 20 Mbps (non-upgrade traffic)
  - **Available for Upgrades**: 30 Mbps
  - **Cost Consideration**: High cost per GB from Earth

- **Communication Windows**:
  - Primary relay: 95% uptime
  - Backup relay: Available during primary outages
  - Rare blackout periods: < 2 hours/month during solar events

### 3.2 Physical & Environmental Constraints
- **No Physical Access for Debugging**:
  - Cannot physically reboot servers easily
  - Limited spare hardware (next resupply mission in 3-6 months)
  - Remote KVM/IPMI must work flawlessly

- **Environmental Challenges**:
  - Extreme temperature swings (-173°C to 127°C outside)
  - Radiation effects on hardware (cosmic rays, solar events)
  - Dust contamination (lunar regolith is abrasive and electrostatically charged)
  - Micro-meteorite risk (small but non-zero)

- **Power Constraints**:
  - Solar + nuclear power mix
  - Battery backup for critical systems
  - Power-saving modes during lunar night (14 Earth days)

### 3.3 Criticality & Safety
- **Life-Critical Systems** (subset of Tier 1):
  - Atmosphere control and oxygen generation
  - Temperature regulation
  - Emergency communications
  - Medical systems
  - **Requirement**: N+2 redundancy, never upgrade more than 1 redundant instance simultaneously

- **Mission-Critical Systems** (Tier 1 + Tier 2):
  - Cannot risk complete failure
  - Must maintain operational capability at all times
  - Require extensive pre-testing in staging environment

- **Human Safety**:
  - Lunar base crew size: 20-50 people
  - Evacuation capability limited (emergency return to Earth takes 3 days)
  - System failures can be life-threatening
