# Phase 2 â€” System Design Concepts (linked)

This document collects the system-design concepts relevant to the Lunar Server Upgrade System and links to focused, short explainer documents under `system-design/concepts/`.

High-level summary
- Priority concepts: bandwidth-aware artifact distribution (P2P), staged/rolled upgrades, health-check-driven rollbacks, safe orchestration for life-critical systems, robust monitoring and alerting, and asynchronous coordination for large-scale campaigns.
